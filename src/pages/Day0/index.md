My name is Bart Tokarz and I have decided to embark on the 100 Days of Code Challenge. I will attempt to code every day for the next 100 days in order to better my coding abilities and create some meaningful projects. This article will detail my setup and goals.

###Background

I recently graduated with a Computer Science degree and my goal is to become a full time Web Developer. I have created some basic websites for myself as well as for my family so I am not completely new to web development. My goal over these 100 days is to expand my knowledge as well as to learn new technologies to advance my abilities.

###Goals

I have a few ideas in mind as to what I will try to create as well as what technologies I would like to explore during this time. This list may change as time goes on depending on other ideas that come up.

1. Personal portfolio website
2. Simple Javascript/HTML/CSS todo style application
3. Update a previous Angular recipe app
4. Dashboard style application implementing multiple API's
5. Work through some React tutorials
6. Full stack web application utilizing React
7. Simple e-commerce store

###First Step: Blog

This post is titled Day 0, because technically I am not writing much code. I though that keeping a blog would allow me to keep track of progress as well as to help other that may be embarking on this journey. This blog is created from one of the Netlify JAMstack templates found here: [https://templates.netlify.com/](https://templates.netlify.com/). 

I have messed around with Netlify a bit and I love their hosting for static websites. These templates can be deployed with a few clicks if you log into Netlify with your GitHub account. I chose the _Gatsby developer blog_ template because I liked the look and feel of it as well as the React/Gatsby/GraphQL stack it was built with.

Once deployed, I cloned the newly created repository to my computer. This allows me to make changes to the project, and Netlify will automatically run the build process and deploy the new version of the website whenever I push code to GitHub. I will likely make some visual changes to this blog once I become more familiar with React and have a chance to dive into Gatsby.

###Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat

Now that the blog is up and running, the next step is to get to coding! I will post here periodically to provide status updates and lessons learned. I will likely keep the posts smaller than this one until I finish a project and provide a more detailed write up. **Let's get coding!**
