title: Day 1 - New Domains, New Project
date: "2019-03-01"

The first project I am working on is a Portfolio site which will highlight my skills and link to my projects. I will be updating this website whenever I create new projects. Also, .dev domains became publicly available to I picked one up for this blog.

###Portfolio Project

For my portfolio, the focus will be on plain HTML/CSS/Javascript. The goal is to create something simple but also visually appealing. I am using Netlify to host this project as well, because you just can't beat the _price_ (free), as well as the ease of having the GitHub integration. This also allows me to use a web IDE to clone the repo and make changes from work when I am on break. I am using [coder.com](https://coder.com/) for this purpose.

I created the main splash screen, which is a simple background with some animated text. I came across an animated signature project a few weeks ago using [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) and I loved the look of it so I knew I wanted to add it to this project. I am just using a sample placeholder for now until I can create an SVG of my actual signature that I am happy with.

###Domain Name Updates

Yesterday (January 28, 2019), .dev domain names became available to the public. I picked up the [100daysofcode.dev](https://www.100daysofcode.dev/) domain for this blog. I also picked up [barttokarz.com](https://www.barttokarz.com) to use for my portfolio. I set up redirects to route them to the Netlify pages by changing the CNAME and A record. This was a very easy process and Netlify even provisions HTTPS certificates for the domains for free as well.

###Next Steps

I will continue working on my Portfolio project until it has enough features to make it look and feel complete. The next steps will be to add a transition to the main page which will contain the main content. Just a few of the features I will try to add eventually include:

* Project Listing
* Skills/Tools Section
* Contact Form
* Social/GitHub/Resume Links
* Possibly use GitHub API to show some stats
